This plugin integrates the [RAP Widget Toolkit (RWT)|http://eclipse.org/rap/developers-guide/devguide.php?topic=rwt.html&version=2.0] - a
web-based Ajax/JavaScript widget library similar to SWT - into your Grails application.

RWT is the web UI part of the [Remote Application Platform (RAP)|http://www.eclipse.org/rap] - an
application framework based on the [Eclipse platform|http://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform].
RWT is provided in
[standalone|http://eclipse.org/rap/developers-guide/devguide.php?topic=rwt-standalone.html&version=2.0]
mode by this plugin, without the full RAP workbench or OSGi. Besides the SWT API, you can use the
[JFace API|http://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace] to build your user interfaces.

RWT enables you to create highly interactive, desktop-like Ajax interfaces by only writing
Java/Groovy code. In contrast to the popular [Google Web Toolkit|http://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/] ([Grails plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/gwt]),
RWT is not compiled to JavaScript, but provides its own set of JavaScript widget that communicate
transparently with your server-side code. Since basically everything happens on the server-side
(besides the rendering in the browser), it is not necessary to use DTOs or other transfer objects
to display the data on the client. The domain objects can be seamlessly used in the UI logic (e.g.
via [DataBinding|http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFace_Data_Binding]).

For more information please refer to the documentation of the particular technology.

The following pages will provide you with the necessary information to get started with Grails and
RWT. Have fun!
